## The Website
The initial idea was to write down some lab notes for my personal use and stash them in an ever-accessible place so I could retrieve them when necessary. The markdown format was perfect to take notes while taking advantage of equation and image rendering.
 I then discovered on the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) engine to generate blogs easily and on the beautiful and amazingly well documented theme [Feeling Responsive](http://phlow.github.io/feeling-responsive/). I only had to adapt the theme to my content.
