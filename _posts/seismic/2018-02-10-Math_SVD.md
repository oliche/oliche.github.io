## SVD
For an inverse problem:
$$
d = Gm
$$
-	$$d(l)$$ is the data vector
-	$$G(l,n)$$ the forward model matrix
-	$$m(n)$$ the model vector.

The following decomposition always exists:
$$
G = USV^T
$$

-	$$U(l,l)$$ is an orthogonal matrix containing unit basis vectors of the data space
-	$$S(l,n)$$ is a diagonal matrix with **singular values** on the diagonal
-	$$V(n,n)$$ is an orthogonal matrix containing unit basis vectors of the model space

If $$G$$ has a rank $$p$$, $$S$$ has only $$p$$ singular values

$$
G = U_pS_pV_p^T
$$
These are the reduced matrices sizes:
-	$U(l,p)$
-	$S(p,p)$
-	$V(n,n-p)$

## PCA

**Preprocessing** : each feature has to be centered and scaled.
```
m = 100; % n samples
n = 21; % nfeatures
k = 5;  % number of desired output features
x = rand(100,21);
Sigma = cov(x);
[U,S,V] = svd(Sigma);
```
-   Retain only the first $k$ columns of $U$.
```
U_ = U(:,1:k);
```
-   Apply the transform to the original $x$ vector to get the new features $z$
```
z = x * U_;
```
$$z = U_{red}^Tx$$

-	$x(m,n)$
-	$\Sigma(n,n)$
-	$U(n,n)$
-	$U_{red}(n,k)$
